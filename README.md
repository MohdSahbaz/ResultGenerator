- **Add Result:** A form to add new student results to the database.
- **View Result:** View the details of a single student's result.
- **Edit/Delete:** Options to update or remove a student's result.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for building the backend of the application.
- **Express:** Web framework for handling routes and server logic.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing student results.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** Templating engine for rendering dynamic web pages.
